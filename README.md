# EndlessRunner

-	So basically the game “Endless Runner” is a running game where it   will contain a level where you as a player need to try to outperform the object and to get the score as high as possible, the player will be a different color or it will have a mark (not decided) and to try to get to the finish line without touching the objects  , the game will be simple but as the game goes the speed increases so it gets more challenging.
-	The design is all original made from unity materials and the gameplay is simple, so it’s a game made for having fun while playing.
-	The player will be a circle-shaped unity with a plain skin which maybe in the future I will add some skins to it, and maybe skins to the platform and the player has gotten 3 trails that follow the player.
-	The main strength of this game is the simplicity of the game also for gameplay because for the player you just need to move right, left, up and down and the level will be also simple design and simple mechanism to beat the game with 4 different sections.
-	The coolest part of this game is that it is made to relax while playing the game and not stress out from it-a stress less game, while you eat, school when you have free time, whenever, wherever.
-	It is better to check the game.
